----------------------------------------------
Raspberry Pwn Installation Steps:
----------------------------------------------

1. Log onto the system and change to the root user:

  pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo -s

2. Confirm your Raspberry Pi Debian release is wheezy/sid:

  root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# cat /etc/debian_version 
  wheezy/sid

3. Confirm you have internet access from your Raspberry Pi:

  root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# ping google.com

4. Install git:

  root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# apt-get -y install git-core

5. Download the Raspberry Pwn installer from the Pwnie Express Github repository:

  root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# git clone https://github.com/pwnieexpress/Raspberry-Pwn.git

6. CD into the Raspberry-Pwn folder and run the install script:

  root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# cd Raspberry-Pwn
  root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# ./INSTALL_raspberry_pwn.sh


----------------------------------------------
Known Issues
----------------------------------------------

1. The Debian Wheezy package servers are only temporarily used during install, due to issues with the 'apt' package. Raspbian package servers are left after install. This means that updates to the Raspberry pwn packages will not be available unless the Debian packages are added back. This can be done by adding to the /etc/apt/sources.list the line below. HOWEVER - testing indicated that performing an apt-get upgrade with these servers in the sources.list led to instability. It is recommended you do not perform an upgrade with them.
